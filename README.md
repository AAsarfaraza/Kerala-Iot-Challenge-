# Kerala-Iot-Challenge-
Foxlab Makerspace in association with GTech - Group of Technology Companies in Kerala is launching our prestigious program “Kerala IoT Challenge 2021”, with a vision to mould 100 IoT experts in Kerala, hosting on the µLearn platform. Kerala IoT Challenge is a program designed in 4 levels followed by a hackathon to identify and train quality industry leaders in the IoT domain, while any novice learner can start with layer 1 and others can enter laterally to the desired layer after an evaluation.
# About Me
Hi everyone! I'm A.A Sarfaraza 2nd year B.Sc Physics student from St. Xavier's College For Women, Aluva. I'm Interested in Cyber Security and App development programs. Also completed a course on Robotics. Now I'm here to explore new dimensions of the "IoT (Internet of things) world".
# LEVEL 1
It consists of total 12 experiments Which can be done using Aurdino UNO board (ATMega328p). It's an open-source microcontroller board developed by Arduino.cc. It has 14 digital output / input pins, 6 analog pins, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button.It has several advantages over the conventional microcontrollers. It comes with a pre-tested software and hardware libraries and has its own integrated development environment (IDE). Also it is less expensive & beginner friendly. 
# EXPERIMENT 1 - "Hello World" Led Blinking
